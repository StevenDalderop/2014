    "To submit your homework, create a folder named lastname_firstinitial_hw# and place your IPython notebooks, data files, and any other files in this folder. Your IPython Notebooks should be completely executed with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code. Compress the folder (please use .zip compression) and submit to the CS109 dropbox in the appropriate folder. If we cannot access your work because these directions are not followed correctly, we will not grade your work.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be using regression and classification to explore different data sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**First**: You will use data from before 2002 in the [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) to create a metric for picking baseball players using linear regression. This is same database we used in Homework 1. This database contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2013, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more\". [Documentation provided here](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2012.txt).\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"Sabermetrics Science\"](http://saberseminar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/saber-web.jpg)\n",
    "http://saberseminar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/saber-web.jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second**: You will use the famous [iris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) data set to perform a $k$-neareast neighbor classification using cross validation.  While it was introduced in 1936, it is still [one of the most popular](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) example data sets in the machine learning community. Wikipedia describes the data set as follows: \"The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.\" Here is an illustration what the four features measure:\n",

    "http://sebastianraschka.com/Images/2014_python_lda/iris_petal_sepal.png\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third**: You will investigate the influence of higher dimensional spaces on the classification using another standard data set in machine learning called the The [digits data set](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_digits.html).  This data set is similar to the MNIST data set discussed in the lecture. The main difference is, that each digit is represented by an 8x8 pixel image patch, which is considerably smaller than the 28x28 pixels from MNIST. In addition, the gray values are restricted to 16 different values (4 bit), instead of 256 (8 bit) for MNIST. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally**: In preparation for Homework 4, we want you to read through the following articles related to predicting the 2014 Senate Midterm Elections. \n",
